What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository, a .git file is made. In this file all
of the commits we will make will be stored here for future use in that
directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
 repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where commits go before they are sent into the 
repository and ones which have not been sent to the working directory.
Instead, these are in a zone where they can be easily altered before
submission
