How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
It allowed me to quickly spot the lines in which there were differences so that I could
focus on a specific area rather than a whole program searching for a type-o

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer?
In the event that you need to revert some changes or recognize where an error started occuring
having records of what the code looked like then and being able to actually compare versions
can be immensely helpful

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Being able to actually choose when to commit allows for logical and complete versions of a program to be saved
rather than the potentially incorrect or uncompilable versions that random commiting would produce

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while
 others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is designed for programmers who typically will find a use for related files whereas docs are more of a
one off and will not use multiple file input.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log allows me to have access to the commit history and to the comments associated with each, 
git diff allows me to actually compare the changes associated with two difference commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If i am going to make a potentially disasterous change to a program, git allows me the 
confidence to do this because worst case scenario, i revert back to the version which did work, or better
yet, i could work on a version, test it, all while the working version is available to the public

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I intend to use Git to help me complete the app development course also offered by udacity
