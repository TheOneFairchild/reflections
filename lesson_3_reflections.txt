When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
If i want to create an opensource project, work on multiple computers,
or host a portfolio
for employers to view.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If i am working on a part of a project, I do not want to have to keep 
reworking my solution to acclimate it to a new code base.
