When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
If i want to create an opensource project, work on multiple computers,
or host a portfolio
for employers to view.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If i am working on a part of a project, I do not want to have to keep 
reworking my solution to acclimate it to a new code base.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
Forks - creating a copy of someones repository that you can edit and 
manipulate while linking original credit to them
branch - in a commit log, a branch allows editing and adding of features
while maintaining the functionality of the master branch
clone - a clone is a copy of a repository so that you can edit it on 
your own machine, This does not give credit like forking does
